Tutorials
=========

These tutorials provide hands-on programming exercises to enable you to
familiarise yourself with creating and running programs using Poplar,
PopLibs and PopART with the PopVision tools. They are intended to complement the 
`Poplar and PopLibs User Guide <https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/>`_.

It is assumed that you have already downloaded and installed the Poplar SDK, and that
you are familiar with Python and command-line compilation tools.

You can download and install the PopVision Graph Analyser and PopVision System Analyser 
from the `Downloads Portal <https://downloads.graphcore.ai/>`_.

The PopVision User Guide is available `here <https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/graphcore-popvision-user-guide/en/latest/>`_.

For most of the tutorials we've included two directories. One, called
``start_here``, contains the bare structure of the tutorial as a starting point
and the other, ``complete``, contains the finished code for reference.
Each tutorial also has a ``test`` directory, which checks that the code can be
compiled and run. See the README file in each test directory for more information.

They can run on a simulated IPU, so you should be able to create the code, compile 
and run them as you work through this text even if you do not have access to IPU hardware.

Each of the tutorials contains its own README file with full instructions.
